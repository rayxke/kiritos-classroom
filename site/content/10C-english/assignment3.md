***Friendly reminder: Remember to proofread your paper!***

        Donâ€™t be like this at the end of the semester!

Me: But Keary I turned in my paper why is my grade so low?

Keary: Did you turn it in on time? Did you have a well supported thesis? How well did you use quote blending or sufficient examples from the movie?
