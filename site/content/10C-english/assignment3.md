## Grading
- Submit the PPT on Time
    - Submit on 9/30 AND bring it to class on a USB
- Cite at least **three** sources for your presentation
- Eye Contact
    - Do not read from script
- Pronunciation
    - If it effects my understanding I will lower your grade
    - Look up the words you will use before presenting! 
- Volume
    - Make sure to speak loud enough for me to hear you

***Friendly reminder: Remember to rehearse your presentation!***

        Donâ€™t be like this at the end of the semester!

Me: But Keary I presented why is my grade so low?

Keary: Did you have good eye contact, pronunciation and volume? Did your Powerpoint include good visual aids and short sentence prompts.
