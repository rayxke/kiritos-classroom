***Friendly reminder!***

        Donâ€™t be like this at the end of the semester!

Me: But Teacher I submitted my assignment why is my grade so low?

Teacher: Did you submit both a rough draft of your argumentative position paper AND a PPT of the opening statement and rebuttal? Did your PPT include the recorded audio? Was your PPT a wall of text?
