## Grading

### Speaking (40%)
There will be two speaking assignments each worth 20 points. The first is a short powerpoint presentation of a position argument and a rebuttal. The other portion of the grade comes from the in class debate. The in-class debate is a semester long project and so should be thoroughly prepared.

### Writing (40%)
There will be two writing assignments each worth 20 points. The first is a rough draft of the argumentative position paper. The second is the final draft of the argumentative position paper. It is important to apply the feedback given to the rough draft in the final draft of your paper.

### Homework and Participation (20%)
Homework assignments will mostly be short written assignments honing concepts and debate techniques covered in class as well as guiding you in crafting both your argumentative position paper and in class debate material. Participation means coming to class and having an active part in discussions and activities. This is important as class time is the best time to practice oral debate.
