***Friendly reminder: Remember to rehearse your presentation!***

        Donâ€™t be like this at the end of the semester!

Me: But Teacher I submitted why is my grade so low?

Teacher: Was your research paper 800-1000 words? Did it conform to MLA standards? Were there sufficient references from reliable sources? (Not just Naver and Google)
